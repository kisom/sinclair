# Sinclair - a bespoke blog engine

Sinclair is a dynamic blogging engine. It works by initialising the engine
from disk, loading relevant information into a redis key store. When it is
alerted to update or add a new post/page, it rescans the appropriate files.

It's a combination of the blogging engine I want and some of the ideas
I want to play with. It is highly unlikely this will be useful to
other people.
